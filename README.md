# QGIS-Geographical-detector

QGIS geographical detector plugin: Tool for measuring spatial stratified heterogeneity and spatial associations of geographical attributes.


## Geographical detector
Geographical detector, or GeoDetector, is a statistical tool to measure Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity (SSH) and to make attribution for/by SSH; 
(1) measure and find SSH among data;
(2) test the coupling between two variables Y and X and 
(3) investigate interaction between two explanatory variables X1 and X2 to a response variable Y.
