## Geographical detector
Geographical detector is a statistical tool to measure Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity (SSH) and to make attribution for/by SSH; 
(1) measure and find SSH among data;
(2) test the coupling between two variables Y and X and 
(3) investigate interaction between two explanatory variables X1 and X2 to a response variable Y.
